<h3><a id="user-content-moonlight-nvidia-gamestreaming-app" class="anchor" href="#moonlight-nvidia-gamestreaming-app" aria-hidden="true"></a>Moonlight Nvidia Gamestreaming App</h3>
Instructions: PC Requirements and setup as follows:

PC Requirements:
A PC with an Nvidia 600 GPU or newer
<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/" rel="nofollow">GeForce Experience app</a>
<ol>
 	<li>You'll need to make sure your streaming PC and your rk3326 device with the supported linux distro are connected to the same network.</li>
 	<li>When you launch Moonlight from the ports menu, you'll be presented with a menu with 2 options, Start Streaming and settings. You'll want to go to settings first and choose the pair option.</li>
 	<li>You'll be presented with a screen asking for the name or IP address of your PC with the Nvidia Geforce Experience app installed.</li>
 	<li>Once you hit the ok button, you should be presented with a pairing dialog box on your PC.</li>
 	<li>Enter the 4 digit PIN displayed on your device into the pairing dialog box and click the Connect button.</li>
 	<li>By default, Moonlight is setup to stream Steam from your PC. There are other options available such as Dolphin if you have that installed and configured on your PC.</li>
</ol>
Notes:
<ul>
 	<li>To ensure that you have controls in your games while streaming, be sure to disconnect any game controllers from your PC and reboot your PC before you start your streaming session.</li>
 	<li>More information about Moonlight is available <a href="https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-docs/wiki">here</a>.</li>
 	<li>If you experience issues with the setup and launching menu functioning correctly, hitting start may resolve it or simply force close the port using the usual exit hotkey on ArkOS or supported linux distro for your device (RGB10 = Minus + Start, RK2020/RG351P/M/V/MP = Select+Start, Chi = 1 + Start).</li>
 	<li>For those that don't have an Nvidia vide card, there's an alternative PC client called <a href="https://github.com/loki-47-6F-64/sunshine">Sunshine</a>. I haven't tested it so I don't know how well it will work but there's been reports that it seems to work well.</li>
 	<li>To exit Moonlight when complete, you can press Select+Start+L1+R1 or simply use the exit hotkey for your device to get out of the app.</li>
 	<li>If you experience issues reconnecting to your PC, go to settings in the Moonlight app and unpair the PC then do another pair again.</li>
 	<li>There has been an instance where Moonlight would not work with a PC unless the HDMI connection was removed from the PC to a TV.</li>
 	<li>You can add more apps for streaming by editing the Moonlight.sh file and adding more apps between lines 167 and 173. Be aware that the entries are case sensitive.</li>
 	<li>Mouse control is only possible using the Rockchip platform in settings. That is only possible on the OGA, OGS, RGB10, and the RK2020 at this time. Holding start for about 2 - 3 seconds while using the Rockchip platform will switch to mouse mode. Hold Start for about 2 - 3 seconds again to switch back to gamepad controls.</li>

<ul>
 	<li>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/RSDKv5-Decompilation">Rubberduckycooly</a> for the decompilation work that makes this possible. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/TheGammaSqueeze/RSDKv5-Decompilation">TheGammaSqueeze</a> for the porting work.</li>
 	<li>Please note that the game comes preconfigured for displaying on a 640x480 device (ex. RG351V and RG353V/VS). Unfortunately this truncates the menus a little but does not affect gameplay (the ring and lives hud are placed correctly). If you go to Options then Video, you can force Fullscreen to On and restart the game and it will set the screen to fullscreen for widescreen devices but add black bars at the top and bottom of 4:3 screens like the RG351V. Once you've made this change, you can't go back to 4:3 without either manually editing the settings.ini file within the sonicmania port folder and changing pixWidth to 320 and fullscreen to 0, or redownload the port through portmaster which will overwrite this settings.ini file with the default one provided in the port package that is preconfigured for 4:3.</li>
 	<li>To access DLC (Sonic Mania Plus), per the developer's <a href="https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/RSDKv5-Decompilation/blob/master/LICENSE.md">license requirements</a>, users need to compile this themselves. Thanks to romadu, the compile process has been made as simple as possible by providing a single GitHub repo that can be compiled on a device with ArkOS by following these instructions available <a href="https://github.com/romadu/RSDKv5-Decompilation/blob/master/README.md#building-on-device-with-arkos">here</a>.</li>

<ol>
 	<li>Obtain any version of SorR. You can use either the windows or linux/debian version it does not matter which.</li>
 	<li>Extract them /roms/ports/sorr (For RG351V if using SD2, extract to /roms2/ports/sorr instead). You should have a /mod folder, a /palettes folder, and SorR.dat file in this location in order for the game to work.</li>
 	<li>Then go to Ports, and launch SorR
<em>Note</em>: <del>If you experience a slowdown in gameplay after sometime, force exit the game (You can use the normal force exit hotkey combination for your device), then start the game again and it will start from the beginning of the last stage you were on and be full speed for a few more stages. It's the best workaround for the issue for now until someone can figure out and resolve the root cause of the slowdown.</del> [Fixed as of 10/6/2021]</li>

Instructions: Super Mario War files are already included and ready to go. Just start Super Mario War from Ports in the emulationstation menu.

<strong>Netplay</strong>: There's a netplay feature available with the portmaster version that supports network play between multiple units. According to the author (<a href="https://github.com/mmatyas/supermariowar/blob/master/docs/netplay.md">mmatyas</a>) of this feature, it is very much experimental so performance will vary depending on a a number of factors not limited to network latency, connection quality (2.4Ghz vs 5Ghz, vs Wired connection) and if attempting to play over Internet, lag and disconnects. To use this feature: you can do the following:
<ol>
 	<li>One of players has to run the server. This can be done from the netplay menu provided when you launch Super Mario War from the PortMaster version.</li>
 	<li>Server IPs can be added from the netplay menu from within settings. The netplay menu will allow you to easily set Server 1 as your internal IP address, Server 2 as your external IP address. You can also set alternative addresses for these servers as well.</li>
 	<li>Make sure to start the server before you start Super Mario War. Once started, you can join the server using your internal IP address. The other players will need to join via your internal IP if playing on the same local network or your external IP if joining via Internet.
<ul>
 	<li>Be aware that if playing over internet, the unit with the smw server started must have port forwarding on that wifi or wired router's configuration for UDP 12521 to point to the internal IP of the unit running the smw server. If this is not done, Internet based players may not be able to join the smw server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Once connected, a room must be created with a name. With the PortMaster setup, the x and y button can be used to just name the room x or y so the room can be setup and all players can enter the room and start playing.</li>
</ol>

<article class="markdown-body entry-content container-lg">
<h2 dir="auto" tabindex="-1"><a id="user-content-what-is-portmaster" class="anchor" href="#what-is-portmaster" aria-hidden="true"></a>What is PortMaster?</h2>
<p dir="auto">PortMaster is a simple tool that is designed similarly to JohnIrvine's <a href="https://github.com/JohnIrvine1433/ThemeMaster">ThemeMaster</a> themes management tool that allows you to download various game ports that are available for 351Elec, ArkOS, JelOS, RetroOZ, and TheRA for RK3326 based devices. Support for the RG552 has been added as well. A number of ports have been tested and confirmed working with TheRA and RetroOZ. Ports such as Freedom Planet and Maldita Castilla will be working for TheRA soon.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the goals of PortMaster is to not install or upgrade any existing OS libraries for any ports. Any of the ports that need a particular non standard library are maintained within the ports' folder and made available specifically to that port during execution.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most of the the ports available through PortMaster have been configured to launch with proper controls for the Gameforce Chi, Powkiddy RGB10, Anbernic RG351P/M/V/MP, RK2020 and the Odroid Go Advance units. Controls for the Anbernic RG552, Odroid Go Super and the Powkiddy RGB10 Max are also included and have been tested but not as much as the 3.5" RK3326 devices.</p>

<h3 dir="auto" tabindex="-1"><a id="user-content-install-info" class="anchor" href="#install-info" aria-hidden="true"></a>Install info</h3>
<p dir="auto">For ArkOS on supported devices, PortMaster was included with a recent online update. You can locate it in the Options &gt; Tools menu.
For 351Elec/AmberElec, just unzip the contents of PortMaster.zip to your storage/roms/ports folder then run PortMaster.sh from the Ports menu in 351Elec.
For JelOS, it's been intergrated into their most recent releases. Just launch from tools and enjoy!
If you don't have PortMaster there or need to install it manually, you can do the following:</p>

<ul dir="auto">
 	<li>Place the PortMaster folder in /roms/tools. The .sh file <strong>must</strong> remain in the PortMaster folder!
<ul dir="auto">
 	<li>For ArkOS on the RG351V, RG351MP, RG353M, RG353V/VS, or RG503, if SD2 is being used for roms, installation must be in /roms2/tools/. The .sh file <strong>must</strong> remain in the PortMaster folder!</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Run PortMaster from ArkOS, TheRA or RetroOZ through Options &gt; Tools &gt; PortMaster menu, 351Elec/AmberElec from Ports &gt; PortMaster menu</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="auto" tabindex="-1"><a id="user-content-do-i-have-to-use-portmaster-to-install-ports" class="anchor" href="#do-i-have-to-use-portmaster-to-install-ports" aria-hidden="true"></a>Do I have to use PortMaster to install ports?</h2>
<p dir="auto">No. You can simply go to the PortMaster repo (<a href="https://github.com/christianhaitian/PortMaster">https://github.com/christianhaitian/PortMaster</a>), find the .zip of the port you want, download it and unzip the contents of it to the /roms/ports folder. You'll also need to copy the PortMaster folder to your /roms/ports folder. If you don't want the PortMaster folder to show up in your Ports menu in Emulationstation, just delete the PortMaster.sh file as it won't be needed if you don't plan to install or update your ports online via this tool. \</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: For ArkOS on the RG351V or RG351MP, if SD2 is being used for roms, unzip the port to the /roms2/ports folder instead and copy the PortMaster folder to the /roms2/tools location. A few additional ports are available on the large releases repo (<a href="https://github.com/PortsMaster/PortMaster-Releases/releases">https://github.com/PortsMaster/PortMaster-Releases/releases</a>) due to their size (ex. SuperTux, Ur Quan Masters, and FreedroidRPG).</p>

<h2 dir="auto" tabindex="-1"><a id="user-content-how-do-i-get-more-info-about-the-ports-in-this-repo-like-the-sources-used-and-additional-asset-needs-if-applicable" class="anchor" href="#how-do-i-get-more-info-about-the-ports-in-this-repo-like-the-sources-used-and-additional-asset-needs-if-applicable" aria-hidden="true"></a>How do I get more info about the ports in this repo like the sources used and additional asset needs if applicable?</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can find that information via the ArkOS Emulators and Ports information wiki link <a href="https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/ArkOS-Emulators-and-Ports-information#ports">here</a>.</p>

<h2 dir="auto" tabindex="-1"><a id="user-content-if-there-are-updates-to-ports-how-will-that-work" class="anchor" href="#if-there-are-updates-to-ports-how-will-that-work" aria-hidden="true"></a>If there are updates to Ports, how will that work?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Just run PortMaster and reinstall the port. You can also unzip the associated .zip for the port you want and unzip the contents of it to the ports folder. This should install the latest port related files if they've been updated in PortMaster. In most cases, it should not impact any existing game data you had to provide or existing saves unless the updated port made changes to the port backend that impacts previous saves.</p>

<h2 dir="auto" tabindex="-1"><a id="user-content-how-can-i-help-add-ports-to-portmaster" class="anchor" href="#how-can-i-help-add-ports-to-portmaster" aria-hidden="true"></a>How can I help add ports to PortMaster?</h2>
<p dir="auto">See the packaging documentation <a href="https://github.com/christianhaitian/PortMaster/blob/main/docs/packaging.md">here</a> for more info on this. Once you're port packaging has met these minimum requirements, you can either submit a Pull Request of this port package with details about the port such as a description of it and how to add any gamefiles or assets if needed or contact me on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Jd2azKX" rel="nofollow">RGHandhelds</a> discord for further review and advisement.</p>

Most of the the ports available through PortMaster have been configured to launch with proper controls for the Gameforce Chi, Powkiddy RGB10, Anbernic RG351P/M/V/MP, RK2020 and the Odroid Go Advance units. Controls for the Anbernic RG552, Odroid Go Super and the Powkiddy RGB10 Max are also included and have been tested but not as much as the 3.5" RK3326 devices.
